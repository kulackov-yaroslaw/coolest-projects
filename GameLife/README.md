Of course, you know the "Conway's Game of Life". I developed a application, where you can simulate this. You have a field of cells and can make each sell "alive" and "dead" by mouse klick. If you press "space" then your colony of bacteria will live a day. You can see some photos in "photos" folder.

P.s. This project uses OpenGl library. You can find the installation guide in "coolest-projects/opengl".
