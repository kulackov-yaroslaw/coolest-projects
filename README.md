# coolest-projects
My first super cool few projects.

Here i collected some my projects from 2014-2015 years. I did not fix the code style, fix bugs and try to improve the runtime. Everything has been preserved in the form that it was so many years ago. Sometimes I open these projects to remember the old days and see how much I have become better.
Despite the fact that these projects were made by me in the 7-8th grade, they are all insanely cool. I'm proud of them.
