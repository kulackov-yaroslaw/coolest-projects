This app allows you to play a sapper. In fact it uses OpenGl library, which do not support text or numbers, so i use colors instead of numbers. 
Here it is: 1 = blue, green = 2, red = 3, etc. You can open cell by RightClick, if you think, that there is a mine, you can marked this cell by a flag by LeftClick, and you can click on the collor cells, which represents how many bombs are around them (in this case you will open all cells around this one).

P.S. You need a OpenGl library!
